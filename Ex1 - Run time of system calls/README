Assignment1:
-----------
strace command gave us inforamation about all the system calls
that happened in WhatIDo file.
we got (after brk(NULL)) 10 systems calls.
In the overall we concluded that the program make 2 directories
one inside the other. make one file and write to him.
after that its getting out the file and delete everything he made.

the first directory with the name "Welcome"
and inside this the directory "To".
Those were the first 2 lines with mkdir sys calls.

after that we have "openat" that open if the file is exist
and make the file in case it not exist. this is our case so
the program made new file with the name "OS2021".

the 4 line, with the sys call "fstat", check the status of the file. 
if everything is ok.

the 5 line, with the sys call  "write", write to the file "OS2021"
a line with the cse user name and suggestion to read the guidelines.

the 6 line, with the sys call  "close", simply close the file.
the 7 line, with the sys call  "unlink", cut the connection to the file,
making it safe to delete the directories.
the 8 line, with the sys call  "rmdir", delete the "To" directory.
the 9 line, with the sys call  "rmdir", delete the "Welcome" directory.
the 10 line, with the sys call  "exit_group", terminate the calling process.
